Looking at the hex of the image, we find that the image has header hex resembling both pngs and jpgs.
However, further investigation reveals that the image is actually a png, which we know from looking
at the other chunks of data.

If we add the appropriate headers and footers for the png, we can fix it and view the flag. (See repaired.png)
flag{pelcgbpgs_vfn_pelcgbtencul_pbzcrgvgvba}

But wait! The server does not accept this flag, so we must suspect that some further decoding is necessary to
get the real flag. Turns out its a rot-13.

flag{cryptoctf_isa_cryptography_competition}
