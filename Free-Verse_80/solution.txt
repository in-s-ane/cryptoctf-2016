Looking at the ciphertext, it doesn't appear to involve any sort of transposition or any real encoding.
However, taking a closer look at the text, we find that the flag is written vertically
starting at the second line beginning with "f".
Read down the characters to get the flag:

flag{this_is_dumb}
