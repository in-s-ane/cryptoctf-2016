Are the words in this sentence completely
random, or do they hide a flag? This sentence
could banana the ceiling cling, or perhaps it
prefers to knock on the drab photo. Anyways,
if there is a flag in a big file like this, it
surely would begin with a { like all the other
ones. However, you have total control over how
to move things around in this file, so do
something about it! You coin the phrase - but
do you do something about something? I don't.

Why have the lines run padded spiders? What in
seven years has the drab cucumber accomplished?
Why do the sentences meet many dumb endings
when there are random blabber monsters under
the witches bed? the flag{} is somewhere in
here, your job is just to find it before you
drive yourself absolutely jolly mad.
