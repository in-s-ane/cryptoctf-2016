Looking at the barcode and numbers given, we can guess that we need to somehow fix the barcode and scan it for the flag.
However, looking at how the barcode for just "flag{" looks like, it seems that we need to remove some of the black lines.
It turns out that we need to erase the
4th, 11th, 15th, 25th, 36th, 47th, 70th, 83rd, 94th, and 104th
black lines.

Scan the repaired barcode to get the flag:
