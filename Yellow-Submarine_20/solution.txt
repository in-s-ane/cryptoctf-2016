Given the name of the problem, we can assume that there is a substitution cipher involved.
Plug the string into the legendary quipqiup to get the flag.

The key used to encode this was the same as the hint, but with repeated letters omitted as they appeared. If you figured that out by hand, you're quite clever, but honestly, most of you probably flag{just_used_quipqiup_anyway}
