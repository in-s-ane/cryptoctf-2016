Immediately this problem sounds like the name of a problem from the 2016 CAMSCTF competition, Dizziness which
involved putting the ciphertext into a square and reading it from there. Conveniently, the ciphertext
can be put in a 17x17 square, so let's see what that reveals:

Reading from the bottom right character and spiraling up in a counter-clockwise direction, we can
read the plaintext:

Why couldn't we just spiral from the top left like normal people? Always so gosh darn difficult. At
least the number of characters was a perfect square, can you imagine if the center had been empty? You wouldn't
have ever found this: flag{73706972616c735f6172655f66756e}. But, you did so.
