Looking at the description of the problem, we are given the following:
1YdMMvL

It definitely doesn't look like a flag, but it does look like the type of randomly generated
string you'd find on a website like pastebin or imgur.
Trying out different websites (including pastebin) with that kind of url, it turns out that it was
a bit.ly link.
