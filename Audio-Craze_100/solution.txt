Unzipping the file gives us a lot of mp3 files, each about a second long.
Listening to each file shows that if we piece them together in the correct order, we will get the flag.
The problem is that we don't know the order we are supposed to listen to them in.

If we run

$ exiftool -track *.mp3

we get a list of all the mp3 files along with their corresponding track number.
Sort the tracks and combine them into one large mp3 to get the flag. (see combine.sh)

flag{puzzled_by_sound}
